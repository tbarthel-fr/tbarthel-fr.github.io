<p>Hi, my name is Thomas Barthélémy. I decided to create this GitHub User Page to introduce myself as well as to present some of my personal projects. Have a good time there (=</p>

<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h1>

<p>Since I was a little boy, I have always been interested in computer science and new technology, not only as a user but also as a developer - all my friends from childhood could tell you. Far away from my first console application in junior school, I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne in France. I am specialized in human-computer interface and interaction, software design and knowledge engineering. </p>

<p>For three years now, I have worked a lot during my free time to learn Android development. Recently I reached a new step by publishing my first app on the Play Store and I try to take advantage of any opportunity in order to keep improving my skills in this field. Here are some of Android projects I have been working on, from the most recent to the oldest.</p>

<p>Still in beta test, you have to join the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/104127077976914732043">g+ community</a> to become a beta tester. Be sure that we will appreciate every single feedback, especially on the concept.</p>

<img src="images/moka.png" alt="Chase Whisply banner">
<p><a href="http://themokaproject.github.io/">Moka</a> is based on the idea that we can make brainstorming meetings more reliable and efficient, with no additional hardware required.</p>

<p>Basically, a smartphone application acts like a remote control for the main screen that's usually connected to a projector. Using the remote, the attendants of the meeting that are connected to the main server (either through NFC or manually) are able to add, edit and remove several types of objects such as images, videos, web pages, UML diagrams, post-its, etc. The objects that are added to the platform can be moved, resized or rotated and their content can be edited, all of these operations happening seamlessly in real-time on both the main screen and the other attendants' application (aka remote control).</p>

<p>Moka features several components:</p>

<li>An Android application to revolutionize in-room collaboration.</li>
<li>A JavaScript-based output platform for beautiful realtime rendering.</li>
<li>A powerful Java/Jade-based back-end server for the heavy computation and across devices synchronization.</li>
<li>A public REST-based API for third-party developers to be able to interact and make requests with the back-end server.</li>
<p>You can grab further information (including a demo) on the website <a href="http://themokaproject.github.io/">http://themokaproject.github.io/</a> </p>
