Far away from my first console application in junior school, I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the Université de Technolohie de Compiègne in France. I am specialized in human-computer interface and interaction, software design and knowledge engineering. \r\n## Experience\r\nComing soon...\r\n## Education\r\nComing soon...\r\n\r\n***\r\n# Projects\r\n## Android\r\nFor three years now, I have worked a lot during my free time to learn Android development. Recently I reached a new step by publishing my first app on the Play Store and I try to take advantage of any opportunity in order to keep improving my skills in this field. Here are some of Android projects I have been working on, from the most recent to the oldest.\r\n\r\n### Chase Whisply : an augmented reality open-source project\r\n![Chase Whisply banner](https://github.com/tvbarthel/ChaseWhisplyProject/raw/master/static/banner_chase_whisply.jpg)\r\n\"Chase Whisply\" turns your smartphone into a gun sight that can reveal ghosts living around you.
